<h1 algin=center>Whim's Writing Commission Info</h1>

I am offering fanfiction commissions! I am also willing to write character studies, fan essays, fan poetry, and fanmixes with detailed liner notes. I'm also offering a service that salvages half-written or abandoned ideas if you're wanting to have someone else finsih a piece for you or work with a more detailed idea.

Below are some of fandoms I feel most comfortable writing for (I will also write for OCs and other fandoms as long as the commissioner gives me enough information so I get a feel for the characters/relationships):<br>
<table align=center>
 <tr>
  <th>Yu-Gi-Oh DM</th>
  <th>Yu-Gi-Oh GX</th>
  <th>Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V</th>
  <th>Venture Brothers</th>
  <th>Devilman</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <th>JJBA (Parts 1, 2, & 4)</th>
  <th>Alien</th>
  <th>Hunter x Hunter</th>
  <th>InuYasha</th>
  <th>Hannibal</th>
 </tr>
 </table>
<br>
There are many more fandoms I’m able to write for but these are the ones I'm into currently. I am comfortable writing for pretty much any horror series (I’ve seen too many films to list) and also writing certain kinds of RPF (I will not write about minors or anything that incites violence against a real person).<p>

I specialize in writing stories with horror elements, guro/eroguro, possession, codependency, hurt/comfort, and also just plain silly crack fics. I also love essay style writing, so if there’s a ship that you’d like a manifesto for I am more than happy to supply.<br>

I am comfortable writing NSFW fics, however I reserve the right to decline writing proposals without explanation. This will be handled professionally, as I may not be the best person to do certain topics justice.<br>

 <h2>TOS</h2> Payment must come upfront before I start writing. Commissioners must be over the age of 18 and by commissioning me you certify that you are a legal adult. As the writer, I reserve the right to publish written works on my own site, AO3, or any other place that promotes my writing. I also retain the rights to all pieces I write and may use them as part of future portfolios, published works, etc. You may not resell or claim my work as your own. You may repost my work on your own site as long as you credit me. If you are requesting my fic salvage services, you must credit me as co-author if it's something you publish on your own. If you would like your commission completely private, you must pay double the cost of the regular commission.

<h2>Refunds</h2> <p align=center>If the commissoner needs a refund before the piece is finished, please see the refund rates below:</p>
 <table align=center>
  <tr>
   <th>Not started</th>
  <td>Full refund</td></tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Started, not much done</th>
   <td>85% refund</td></tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Started, halfway done</th>
   <td>50% refund</td></tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Nearly completed</th>
   <td>25% refund</td></tr>
  <tr>
   <th>Finished but not yet shown </th>
    <td>No refund</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
 </p>

  <h2>Prices</h2> Please note that I will round up the price for longer pieces after hitting 500 words–for example, if you commission a fanfic that is 1500 words, it will cost $60. The commissoner is also responsible for covering transaction fees, so there will a processing charge added to the final invoice to cover these fees.

<table align=center>
 <tr>
  <th>Ficlet (500-900 words)</th> <td>$20</td></tr>
 <tr>
  <th>Fanfic/essay</th> <td>$30 per 1000 words**</td></tr>
 <tr><th>Fanfic salvage</th> <td>price negotiable</td></tr>
 <tr>
  <th>*Fanmix with liner notes (8 songs)</th> <td>$25</td></tr>
 <tr>
  <th>*Fanpoem</th> <td>$20</td></tr>
 </table>
  <p align=center><small><i>*Please let me know if there is a genre or structure you’d prefer for a fanmix or poem.</i></small><br>
  <small><i>**I reserve the right to round up when over 500 words into a word count tier.</i></small></p>

I will reply to commission requests in 1-3 days. I will write up an invoice with estimated completion time and keep the commissioner updated with draft progress until the piece is complete.
