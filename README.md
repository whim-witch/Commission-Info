# Commission-Info

I am offering fanfiction commissions! I am also willing to write character studies, fan essays, fan poetry, and fanmixes with detailed liner notes.

Below are a list of fandoms I feel most comfortable writing for (I will also write for OCs and other fandoms as long as the commissioner gives me enough information so I get a feel for the characters/relationships):

Yu-Gi-Oh DM
Venture Brothers
Devilman
Yu-Gi-Oh GX
JJBA (Parts 1, 2, & 4)
Alien
Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V
Hunter x Hunter
InuYasha


There are many more fandoms I’m comfortable writing for, but these are the ones I discuss the most currently. I am comfortable writing for pretty much any horror series (I’ve seen too many films to list) and also writing certain kinds of RPF (I will not write about minors or anything that incites violence against a real person).

I specialize in writing stories about horror elements, possession, codependency, hurt/comfort, and also just plain silly crack fics. I also love essay style writing, so if there’s a ship that you’d like a manifesto for I am more than happy to supply.

I am also comfortable writing NSFW fics, however I reserve the right to decline a writing a commission proposal without explanation.

TOS: I accept PayPal only, and payment must come upfront before I start writing. Commissioners also must be over the age of 18 and by commissioning me you certify that you are a legal adult. As the writer, I also reserve the right to publish written works on my own site, AO3, or any other place that promotes my writing. I also retain the rights to all pieces I write and may use them as part of future portfolios, published works, etc. You may not resell, or claim my work as your own. You may repost my work on your own site as long as you credit me.

I reserve the right to decline a writing a commission proposal without explanation.

Prices: Please note that I will round up the price for longer pieces after hitting 500 words–for example, if you commission a fanfic that is 1500 words, it will cost $60.

Ficlet (500-900 words) - $20
Fanfic/essay - $30 per 1000 words**
*Fanmix with liner notes (8 songs) - $25
*Fanpoem - $20

*Please let me know if there is a genre or structure you’d prefer for a fanmix or poem.
**I reserve the right to round up when over 500 words into a word count tier.

I will reply to commission requests within 1-3 days. I will write up an invoice with estimated completion time and keep the commissioner updated with draft progress until the piece is complete.
